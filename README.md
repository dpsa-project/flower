# Flower with dpsa4fl

**Warning: This project is work in progress and should not be used in production. The current implementation is a prototype.**

This is a fork of [flower](https://github.com/adap/flower) adapted for the [dpsa project](https://github.com/dpsa-project/overview). The aggregation mechanism of dpsa4fl is used instead of the native aggregation of flower.

See [here](https://github.com/dpsa-project/dpsa4fl-example-project)
for an example project that uses this fork.
