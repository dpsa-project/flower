# Flower with DPSA

This is a fork of [flower](https://github.com/adap/flower), intended for adding a differentially private secure aggregation mechanism to it. Eventually, the goal might be to be included in the original project.

## Development
To execute the development example, run the script in the `dpsa` subfolder.
